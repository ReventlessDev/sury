# Test Guidelines

## Use Wallaby MCP first

- Use Wallaby.js for test results, errors, and debugging
- Leverage runtime values and coverage data when debugging tests
- Fall back to terminal only if Wallaby isn't available

1. Analyze failing tests with Wallaby and identify the cause of the failure.
2. Use Wallaby's covered files to find relevant implementation files or narrow your search.
3. Use Wallaby's runtime values tool and coverage tool to support your reasoning.
4. Suggest and explain a code fix that will resolve the failure.
5. After the fix, use Wallaby's reported test state to confirm that the test now passes.
6. If the test still fails, continue iterating with updated Wallaby data until it passes.
7. If a snapshot update is needed, use Wallaby's snapshot tools for it.

When responding:

- Explain your reasoning step by step.
- Use runtime and coverage data directly to justify your conclusions.

# Sury Architecture

## Schema Input and Output Types

A schema represents two types: Input and Output.

### Example 1: Same Input and Output

```typescript
S.string
// Input: string
// Output: string
```

### Example 2: Different Input and Output

```typescript
S.schema({
  foo: S.string.with(S.to, S.number)
})
// Input: { foo: string }
// Output: { foo: number }
```

The input and output differ because nested items have transformations, even though the schema itself does not have a `.to` property.

## Modifying a Schema

When modifying a schema, the modification applies to the output type.

```typescript
S.schema({
  foo: S.string.with(S.to, S.number)
}).with(S.refine, () => {...})
```

Since this schema does not have `.to`, `inputRefiner` and `refiner` must be stored separately to support `S.reverse`. Every schema should be reversible from Input→Output to Output→Input, unless explicitly prevented.

For modifications like `name` or built-in refinements that do not affect nested items, they apply to both input and output without differentiation.

## Decode Function

The decode function is created from a single schema and transforms the schema's Input to Output. When multiple schemas are joined by the `.to` property, they are automatically combined into a single transformation pipeline.

## Schema Properties and Execution Order

Schema properties are executed in the following order:

1. **decoder** - If input val differs from the schema, decode it to the schema's input type. May skip directly to schema output if there is no inputRefiner.

2. **inputRefiner** - Custom validations on the input part of the schema value.

3. **decoder** - Decodes input to output for the current schema. Typically required to decode nested items such as object fields.

4. **refiner** - Custom validations on the output part of the schema value.

### If Schema Has `.to` Property

5. **parser** - Custom transformation logic to the `.to` schema. The serializer is the reverse of parser.

### If There Is No Parser

5. **encoder** - Transformation logic from the current schema's output to the `.to` schema's input.

6. **.to.decoder** - Starts the cycle from the beginning with the `.to` schema.

## Reversal with S.reverse

`S.reverse` swaps:

- `inputRefiner` ↔ `refiner`
- `parser` ↔ `serializer`
- Reverses the `.to` chain direction

## Async Support

Every transformation may return an async value. To continue the transformation chain:

1. Append `.then()` and continue the logic in the callback function.
2. For nested items (e.g., object fields, array items), create a promise that collects all inner items with `Promise.all()`.

## Val

The `val` represents a value at a specific point in time during compilation. Each `val` reflects a specific value type at that moment.

Key properties:

- `schema` - The actual type of the value at this point
- `expected` - The schema to build decoder for
- `var` - Returns the variable name in generated code
- `inline` - The value as an inline code expression
- `path` - Current location in the data structure (for error messages)

Transformation tracking (relative to `.prev`):

- `prev` - The previous val in the chain, indicating where this value originated from
- `code` - Generated code describing the transformation from `.prev` to this val
- `validation` - Type check condition from `.prev` (e.g., `typeof x === "string"`). Different from custom refiners.

This design allows tracing back through the transformation history, where each step records what code was generated and what validations were applied to get from the previous state to the current one.

- `B.refine` allows to modify the value, by cloning, while keeping the var allocation link.

- `skipTo` is used to abort the parse after finishing current decoder. Ideally to get rid of it and use `val.expected` instead.
